            "I'm sorry, [your suffering is] not enough. <br>
            You know what it's like to be poor, and you know what it's like to work hard. <br>
            Now you're going to learn what it's like to sweep floors and bust your ass and accomplish twice as much as all the kids around you. <br>
            And it won't mean anything because they will still look down on you. <br>
            And you will want so much for them to like you, and they just won't. <br>
            And it'll break your heart. <br>
            And that'll make your heart bigger and open your eyes and finally you will realize that there's more to life than proving you're the smartest person in the world. <br>
            I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path. <br>
            You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury."

            "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then <br>
            retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, <br>
            and let other people clean up the mess they had made..."

        <div class="quote">
            "Then what is good [for you]? The obsessive interest in human affairs, plus a certain amount of <br>
            compassion and moral conviction, that first made the experience of living something that <br>
            must be translated into pigment or music or bodily movement or poetry or prose or anything <br>
            that's dynamic and expressive—that's what's good for you if you're at all serious in your aims. <br>
            William Saroyan wrote a great play on this theme, <b>that purity of heart is the one success worth having.</b> <br>
            'In the time of your life—live!' That time is short and it doesn't return again. It is slipping away while <br>
            I write this and while you read it, and the monosyllable of the clock is <i>Loss, loss, loss</i>, unless <br>
            you devote your heart to its opposition."
